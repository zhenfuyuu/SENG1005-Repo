# SENG1005 Focused Assignment #2
Repository for code involved in the FA #2 for **SENG1005: C Programming.** 
## Usage
The C file itself is in the branch named ["master"](https://github.com/zhenfuyuu/focusAssignmentTwo/tree/master). Do not worry about the CMake files... they're just
my for my IDE's build complier. The main branch will contain the program's required _checklist,_
as well as the templates for [file](https://github.com/zhenfuyuu/focusAssignmentTwo/blob/main/file-template.md) and [function](https://github.com/zhenfuyuu/focusAssignmentTwo/blob/main/function-template.md) headers.
